Step 1: Design the Schema
We'll design the following tables:

Customers: Stores customer information.
Accounts: Stores account details for each customer.
Transactions: Logs all transactions made by customers.
Loans: Keeps track of loans taken by customers.
Branches: Stores information about bank branches.

Step 2: Create Tables with Relationships
Step 3: Establish Relationships
Customers to Accounts: One-to-many relationship, as a customer can have multiple accounts.
Accounts to Transactions: One-to-many relationship, as each account can have multiple transactions.
Customers to Loans: One-to-many relationship, as a customer can have multiple loans.
Branches to Accounts: One-to-many relationship, as a branch can have multiple accounts.

Step 4: Querying the Database
After setting up the tables and relationships, here are some typical tasks an SQL Developer would perform:

Retrieve Data: Write SELECT queries to extract meaningful information.
Example: Fetch all transactions for a particular customer.
Joins: Perform JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.
Example: Get a list of customers along with their account balances.
Aggregate Functions: Use functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc., to get summary statistics.
Example: Calculate the total balance across all accounts.
Data Manipulation: Insert, Update, or Delete data as needed.
Example: Update a customerâ€™s email address.
Optimize Queries: Ensure queries are efficient, using indexes where necessary.
Views and Stored Procedures: Create views for complex queries or stored procedures for repeated operations.
Backup and Restore: Understand the backup and restore process for the database.
Security and Permissions: Manage user roles and permissions for database access.
